# Movie Trailer

This server-side project stores a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery, movie trailer URL, and some details about the movies.

### To Run

To run this python project, make sure you have Python 2 installed on your machine. Then, simply run
```python
$ python entertainment_center.py
```
in the same directory to generate a new tab in your default browser with a list of my favorite movies!
